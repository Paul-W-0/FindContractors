# FindContractors
* Some things to note:

- Quite a few features are not yet implemented, so you may see a lot missing.
- If this website is ever published onto the internet then the secret key WILL be regenerated and all security vulnerabilities and problems will be fixed prior to doing so.
- You will notice that the security report page's link for normal users is not in the footer yet, you will need to go refer to the urls.py file to see all the links available in the website.
- Currently I'm using the console backend for emailing because I don't want to get emailed every single time I'm testing a specific feature to see if it works or not.
- Anyone who is familiar with Python, and Django is welcome to contribute to this repository.
- This is not a published website, and is still in heavy development.
- If this website is ever published then all security keys and such will be regenerated.
